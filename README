# Catan Randomiser 

The Catan Randomiser is a program designed to produce random Settlers of Catan board layouts.

Currently it uses tiles from the main game, and the first two expansions (Seafarers and Cities and Knights), to produce six player boards.

The program is written in Python with a Kivy frontend.
